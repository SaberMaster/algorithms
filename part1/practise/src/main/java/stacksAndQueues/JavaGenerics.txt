Java generics. Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

i think because the basic date type such as int, double
don't want to transfer it to Integer, Double Object


Hint: to start, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant but Java generics are not: that is, 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐[] is a subtype of 𝙾𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝[], but 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚔<𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐> is not a subtype of 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚔<𝙾𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>.
